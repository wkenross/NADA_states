    ## Vehicles Valued by the Georgia Department of Revenue using NADA
        In the state of Georgia, vehicles are valued for excise and use tax purposes based on the fair market value of the vehicle. 
        The fair market value is determined by the Georgia Department of Revenue using the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) Official Used Car Guide or other recognized pricing guides. 
        The fair market value is the amount that the vehicle would sell for on the open market between a willing buyer and seller, both knowledgeable about the vehicle and under no pressure to buy or sell. 
        It is important to note that the fair market value may be different from the purchase price or the value listed on the vehicle's title.

# Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles

        https://public.powerdms.com/ladpsc/documents/370218

        Louisiana law requires payment of road usage tax for all motor vehicles imported to this state for use upon the highways of Louisiana. 
        Payment of road usage tax is required prior to issuance of a Louisiana title or registration. 

    - Road use tax assessed at the NADA value
        National Automobile Dealers Association (N.A.D.A.) - A vehicle valuation guide
            Road Use Tax- Tax imposed on tangible personal property being transferred into the state of Louisiana for use. 
            Road Use tax differs from sales tax, because it is assessed on the N.A.D.A. value, rather than the sales price of the vehicle.    

    - Road use tax shall be assessed at the following rates:
        State Tax
        Parish/municipality tax shall be assessed based on the rate at the location in which the vehicle is domiciled.


    # Use of NADA for Road use tax
        - Road use Tax due is based upon:
            -- NADA Official Used Car Guide – The loan value of the vehicle being titled
            -- NADA Valuation Guide (Online) – Average Trade-In of the vehicle being titled
                 Antique vehicle files that do not return an average trade value on NADA must be taxed on the low retail value listed on the NADA Valuation Guide (Online) or the 
                file must be accompanied by a letter from a dealership authorized to sell that type of vehicle, on letterhead, indicating the value.
                - Trailers will not return a value on NADA. The file must contain a letter from a dealership authorized to sell trailers, on letterhead, indicating the value.
                - Motorhomes that do not return an average trade value on NADA must be 
                        accompanied by a letter from a dealership authorized to sell that type of vehicle, 
                        on letterhead, indicating the value.
                - Newer model vehicles, not indicated in the NADA guide, shall be assessed road 
                use tax based on the original invoice price less 15% to determine the current 
                taxable value
