    - Can you describe how vehicle use tax is determined by Idaho State Tax Commission?
        In Idaho, vehicle use tax is determined based on the purchase price or current value of the vehicle, whichever is greater. 
        The tax rate varies depending on the type of vehicle and whether or not the purchaser is a resident of Idaho. 
            For passenger vehicles, the tax rate is 6% of the purchase price or current value. For commercial vehicles, the tax rate is 8% for non-residents or 6% for residents, with a maximum tax of $62.50 for vehicles with a declared weight of less than 8,000 pounds. 
            It's worth noting that Idaho also has a maximum tax limit that applies to all vehicles, which is currently set at $53, however, the maximum tax limit is not applicable for vehicles in the commercial category. 
            Additionally, there may be local option taxes which can vary depending on where the vehicle is registered. The Idaho State Tax Commission website has a helpful resource for calculating and paying vehicle use tax.
    - How does Iadaho State Tax Commmission determine current value of a vehicle
        The Idaho State Tax Commission uses a standard pricing guide to determine the current value of a vehicle for tax purposes. 
        The most popular pricing guides used by the commission are the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) guide, the Kelley Blue Book (KBB), 
        and the Used Car Guide published by the National Auto Research (NAR).

        The Idaho State Tax Commission compares the purchase price with the current value of the vehicle on the date of purchase to establish its taxable value. 
        If the purchase price is less than the current value of the vehicle, the taxable value is the current value at the time of purchase.
