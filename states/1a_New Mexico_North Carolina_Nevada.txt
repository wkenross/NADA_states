        The property tax in North Carolina is a locally assessed tax, collected by the counties. 

        The Department of Revenue is charged with the duty to exercise general and specific supervision over the valuation and taxation of property by taxing units throughout the State. 
        The Property Tax Division of the North Carolina Department of Revenue is the division responsible for this administration.
