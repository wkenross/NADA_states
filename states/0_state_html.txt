# Convert TXT to Markdown

        - Hyperlinks
            you can create hyperlinks by enclosing the text you want to turn into a link in square brackets `[ ]`, followed by the URL in parentheses `( )`
            -**Bold**: To make the link text bold, enclose it in double asterisks `** **`, like this:
                --**[hyperlink](https://www.example.com)**
            -Italic_: To make the link text italic, enclose it in single underscores `_ _`, like this:
               --_[hyperlink](https://www.example.com)_
            -Emphasis: Use a combination of bold and italic with asterisks and underscores for emphasis. For example:
               --***[hyperlink](https://www.example.com)***
        - Bullets
            To create a bullet point in Markdown, simply begin the line with an asterisk (`*`) or a hyphen (`-`), followed by a space and the text of the bullet point.

        - Here's an example of how to insert an image into a Markdown file:
            ```
            ![alt text](image.jpg "Title"){width=50%}
            ```
                - In this example, `alt text` is the alternative text to display if the image cannot be loaded or seen. `image.jpg` is the file path to the image file, and `"Title"` is the optional title text for the image.
                - When you convert this Markdown file to HTML using the "Markdown All in One: Print Documents to HTML" extension, the image will appear in the HTML page.
