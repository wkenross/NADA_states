        --Property Valuation Administrator
            January 1 is the assessment date for motor vehicles and the Property Valuation Administrator is the assessor; 
            the County Clerk collects the property tax due on motor vehicles at the time of registration, and is paid a four percent commission to cover the cost of collection.

            Valuation is based on the market, by reference to a table of values derived from the NADA tape calibrated locally through the application of market adjustment factors.

           The assessments of automobiles, pick-ups, small trucks, and vans that are nineteen (19) years old or less are derived from the NADA Official Used Car Guide. 
           All motor vehicles assessed by this guide shall be assessed at the clean trade-in value, less any applicable deductions, unless information is available that warrants any deviation from the standard value

    - Casual selloer pays Michigan Use Tax rather than sales tax
        Under Michigan Sales/Use Tax Statutes, a casual seller, i.e., not a licensed new or used vehicle dealer, is not responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax
         on the sale of a used motor vehicle. Instead, the buyer is subject to Michigan use tax when registering the title with the Michigan Secretary of State office. 

    - Now cross referenced with NADA
        The Michigan Department of Treasury has established a system to cross-reference amounts reported to the Michigan Secretary of State as the sales price
         for a used vehicle transfer to the National Automotive Dealers Association (NADA) database for the retail value of used vehicles. Under Michigan law, the use tax payable on a used vehicle transfer is 6% on the greater of the purchase price or the retail value of the vehicle at the time of transfer.
