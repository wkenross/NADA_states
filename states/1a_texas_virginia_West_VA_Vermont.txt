        --NADA as recognized pricing guide
                The Code of Virginia §58.1-3503 requires the Commissioner of the Revenue to value personal property by means of a recognized pricing guide.  
                The City of Salem uses JD Power car guides (formerly NADA) to determine the value of vehicles at the clean loan value as of January 1st of each year. 
                This assessment method has been used by the Commissioner of the Revenue’s office for over 25 years and the value used is generally one of the lowest in the guide.

        Personal Property is assessed at 60% of the loan value from the NADA (National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) book as mandated
         by the State Tax Commissioner.  Examples include cars, trucks, motorcycles, ATV’s, motor homes, campers, boats trailers etc.  
        State law requires that residents pay yearly taxes on these types of property even if such property is not licensed but still titled with the DMV (Dept. of Motor Vehicles). 
        
    - WV state Tax Department has contracted with the NADA to assess your vehicle
        The West Virginia State Tax Department is required to value vehicles by using a nationally recognized organization which establishes values of used vehicles.

        The WV State Tax Department has contracted with the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) and uses its July edition. 
        Of the three values that appear for each vehicle (retail, trade-in, or loan), the state uses the lowest value, which is loan, 
        to assess your vehicle. NADA produces computer software which matches a vehicle value to each vehicle identification number (VIN). 
        The Harrison County Assessor’s Office enters the VIN in the State computer network for each vehicle. The computer in Charleston reads the VIN and then assigns the loan value to that specific vehicle. There is no consideration given to high or low mileage, body condition, add-on options, etc. You are taxed only on the basic model. Since West Virginia taxes 60% of the market value, the computer takes 60% of the loan value and applies the appropriate levy rate.
